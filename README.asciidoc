Chess pieces detection using YOLOV3

This is a example of using YOLOV3 to perform chess pieces detection whit a very small dataset. 

The model is traind on images from www.chess.com.

For a more generalized model a black and white dataset can be used.

Detection white YOLOV3
----

First clone this Darknet repostory

https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet  

Coppy the folder “ChessPieces” into the subfolder “data” in to the darnet folder.

The directory haze to look like this:

- darnet
	-chess.names
	-test.png
	-testChess.txt
	-trainChess.txt
	-backup
		-chess-yolov3.weights
	-cfg
		-chess.data
		-chess-yolov3.cfg
	-data
		-ChessPieces

Then run the following commands to test the model.

Make

./darknet detector test cfg/chess.data cfg/chess-yolov3.cfg backup/chess-yolov3.weights test.png
----

Training a custom model with YOLOV3
----
Setup your directory as explained above. Then run this command:

./darknet detector test cfg/chess.data cfg/chess-yolov3.cfg backup/chess-yolov3.weights test.png
